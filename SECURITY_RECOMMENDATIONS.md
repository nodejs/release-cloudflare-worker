## üî¥ CRITICAL: CI/CD Secret Exposure Risk

### Summary
The current CI/CD workflows may be vulnerable to secret exposure through various attack vectors including dependency confusion, malicious pull requests, and compromised actions.

### Attack Vectors
1. **Malicious Dependencies**: Compromised npm packages could extract secrets during `npm install`
2. **Compromised GitHub Actions**: Third-party actions could access and exfiltrate secrets
3. **Pull Request Attacks**: Malicious PRs could modify workflows to expose secrets
4. **Dependency Confusion**: Attackers could create packages with similar names to legitimate dependencies

### Likelihood: Medium-High
- CI/CD systems are frequent targets for supply chain attacks
- Current workflow runs on every PR and has access to deployment secrets
- Step-security/harden-runner provides some protection but may not cover all vectors

### Impact: Critical
- `CF_API_TOKEN` exposure could allow unauthorized worker deployments
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK` exposure could enable social engineering attacks
- Could lead to supply chain compromise of Node.js distribution

### Current Mitigations
- ‚úÖ Uses step-security/harden-runner with egress policy restrictions
- ‚úÖ Pins GitHub Actions to specific commit SHAs
- ‚úÖ Separates staging and production deployments

### Recommended Actions

#### High Priority
- [ ] Implement secrets scanning in repository
- [ ] Add OIDC token authentication for Cloudflare deployments instead of long-lived API tokens
- [ ] Restrict workflow permissions to minimum required (add explicit permissions blocks)
- [ ] Implement approval workflow for production deployments

#### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Add supply chain security scanning (e.g., GitHub dependency review action)
- [ ] Implement signed commits requirement for collaborators
- [ ] Add workflow run audit logging
- [ ] Create incident response runbook for secret exposure

#### Low Priority
- [ ] Consider using GitHub Environments with protection rules
- [ ] Implement monitoring/alerting for unusual deployment patterns
- [ ] Regular rotation schedule for all secrets
