## Security Issue: Missing Incident Response Plan

### Summary
The Node.js Release Cloudflare Worker currently lacks a comprehensive, public Incident Response Plan (IRP) specific to this critical infrastructure component. Given that this service powers Node.js distribution for the entire ecosystem, a detailed IRP is essential for maintaining service integrity and user trust.

### Why This Is Critical
- **High Impact Service**: dist.nodejs.org serves Node.js binaries to millions of developers worldwide
- **Supply Chain Risk**: Security incidents could affect the entire Node.js ecosystem
- **Public Infrastructure**: As critical Node.js infrastructure, transparency in incident response builds community trust
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Many organizations require clear incident response procedures for critical dependencies

### Attack Scenarios Requiring IRP

#### 1. Supply Chain Compromise (Critical)
- **Scenario**: Malicious binaries served through cache poisoning or worker compromise
- **Impact**: Widespread compromise of Node.js installations
- **Response Time**: Immediate (< 15 minutes)

#### 2. Service Availability Attack (High)
- **Scenario**: DDoS or resource exhaustion affecting dist.nodejs.org availability
- **Impact**: Node.js ecosystem disruption, development workflow interruption
- **Response Time**: < 30 minutes

#### 3. Data Integrity Incident (High)
- **Scenario**: Corruption of served files or checksums
- **Impact**: Broken installations, security verification failures
- **Response Time**: < 1 hour

#### 4. Information Disclosure (Medium-High)
- **Scenario**: Exposure of internal configuration or infrastructure details
- **Impact**: Increased attack surface, potential for further compromise
- **Response Time**: < 2 hours

### Current State
- ⚠️ No specific IRP for this service
- ⚠️ Relies on general Node.js Security WG incident response
- ⚠️ No defined escalation procedures for dist.nodejs.org specific incidents
- ✅ Sentry error monitoring in place
- ✅ Slack notifications for deployment failures

### Recommended Incident Response Plan Structure

#### 1. Incident Classification and Severity Levels

**P0 - Critical (< 15 min response)**
- Supply chain compromise (serving malicious binaries)
- Complete service outage affecting all users
- Active security exploit with widespread impact

**P1 - High (< 30 min response)**  
- Partial service degradation affecting significant user base
- Cache poisoning incidents
- Detected unauthorized access attempts

**P2 - Medium (< 2 hours response)**
- Individual file corruption or checksum mismatches
- Performance degradation without service impact
- Security configuration issues

**P3 - Low (< 24 hours response)**
- Minor security hardening opportunities
- Non-critical monitoring alerts
- Documentation security issues

#### 2. Response Team Structure

**Incident Commander**
- Overall incident coordination
- Communication with stakeholders
- Decision making authority

**Technical Lead** 
- Technical investigation and remediation
- Worker deployment and rollbacks
- Infrastructure coordination

**Communications Lead**
- External communications (blog posts, advisories)
- Community updates and transparency
- Media relations if needed

**Security Analyst**
- Threat analysis and containment
- Evidence collection and forensics
- Vulnerability assessment

#### 3. Response Procedures

**Initial Response (0-15 minutes)**
- [ ] Incident detection and verification
- [ ] Severity assessment and classification
- [ ] Response team notification and assembly
- [ ] Initial containment measures if needed

**Investigation Phase (15 minutes - 2 hours)**
- [ ] Root cause analysis
- [ ] Impact assessment and scope determination
- [ ] Evidence collection and preservation
- [ ] Stakeholder notification

**Containment and Recovery (Ongoing)**
- [ ] Implement containment measures
- [ ] Deploy fixes or rollbacks as needed
- [ ] Verify service integrity restoration
- [ ] Monitor for additional issues

**Post-Incident Activities**
- [ ] Post-mortem analysis and documentation
- [ ] Lessons learned and process improvements
- [ ] Communication to community about resolution
- [ ] Update security measures and monitoring

### Communication Templates

#### 4. Internal Escalation Contacts
- **@nodejs/web-infra team**: Infrastructure issues
- **@nodejs/security-wg**: Security coordination  
- **@nodejs/tsc**: Major incident escalation
- **Cloudflare Support**: Platform-specific issues

#### 5. External Communication Procedures
- **Security advisories**: Via Node.js blog and security mailing list
- **Service status**: Updates on dist.nodejs.org status page
- **Community updates**: GitHub issues and social media
- **Vendor coordination**: Cloudflare, monitoring services

### Action Items

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Create detailed IRP document** in `/docs/incident-response-plan.md`
- [ ] **Define response team roles** and establish on-call rotation
- [ ] **Create incident response runbooks** for common scenarios
- [ ] **Establish communication templates** for various incident types
- [ ] **Set up incident response tools** (war room, status page)

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Implement automated incident detection** beyond current monitoring
- [ ] **Create incident simulation exercises** for team training
- [ ] **Establish relationships with external parties** (Cloudflare, security researchers)
- [ ] **Document forensics procedures** for evidence collection
- [ ] **Create public status page** for service availability communication

#### Low Priority  
- [ ] **Develop metrics and KPIs** for incident response effectiveness
- [ ] **Create post-incident review templates** for continuous improvement
- [ ] **Establish legal and compliance procedures** for incident reporting
- [ ] **Document lessons learned database** for historical reference

### Success Metrics
- **Response Time**: Meet defined SLAs for each severity level
- **Communication**: Timely and transparent updates to community
- **Recovery Time**: Minimize service disruption duration
- **Prevention**: Reduce recurring incident types through improvements
