# dev-bucket

This is a very slimmed down recreation of the `dist-prod` bucket meant for testing the Release Worker.
The files here have little to no content, they're here just to build the structure of the bucket itself so that the Release Worker can be used in development easier.

For more information on the structure of the bucket, read [R2](../docs/r2.md) and [Release Process](../docs/release-process.md).
