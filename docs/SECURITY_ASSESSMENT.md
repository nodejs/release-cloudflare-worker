   - Location: `src/middleware/r2Middleware.ts:145-181`
   - Issue: `getR2Path()` function has limited path validation
   - Risk: Potential access to unintended files

2. **Input Validation Gaps**
   - Location: Multiple middleware files
   - Issue: Insufficient validation of request parameters
   - Risk: Injection attacks or unexpected behavior

3. **Error Information Disclosure**
   - Location: Error handling throughout codebase
   - Issue: Error messages may leak implementation details
   - Risk: Information disclosure aiding attackers

4. **Cache Security**
   - Location: `src/middleware/cacheMiddleware.ts`
   - Issue: Limited cache key validation
   - Risk: Cache poisoning attacks

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Impact**: Could lead to serving malicious Node.js binaries

### Infrastructure Security

#### Cloudflare Workers Platform
- ‚úÖ Managed platform with built-in security
- ‚úÖ DDoS protection and rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Global edge distribution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration-dependent security (our responsibility)

#### R2 Storage Security
- ‚úÖ Access controlled via IAM tokens
- ‚úÖ Separate staging/production buckets
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Token management in CI/CD
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No file integrity verification

## Attack Scenarios and Risk Assessment

### Scenario 1: Supply Chain Compromise (CRITICAL)
**Attack Vector**: Malicious dependency extracts CI secrets, deploys modified worker
**Likelihood**: Medium (increasing trend in ecosystem)
**Impact**: Critical (serves malicious binaries to millions)
**Mitigation**: OIDC auth, supply chain attestation, enhanced monitoring

### Scenario 2: Cache Poisoning Attack (HIGH)
**Attack Vector**: Crafted requests poison cache to serve incorrect content
**Likelihood**: Medium (requires specific knowledge)
**Impact**: High (incorrect Node.js installations)
**Mitigation**: Cache key validation, integrity checks

### Scenario 3: Path Traversal Exploitation (MEDIUM)
**Attack Vector**: Malicious URLs access unintended files
**Likelihood**: Low-Medium (requires deep knowledge)
**Impact**: Medium (information disclosure)
**Mitigation**: Strict path validation, whitelist approach

### Scenario 4: CI/CD Compromise (HIGH)
**Attack Vector**: Fork PR or compromised action extracts secrets
