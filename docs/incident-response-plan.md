## 1. Overview

This Incident Response Plan (IRP) defines procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents affecting the Node.js Release Cloudflare Worker that powers https://dist.nodejs.org. This service is critical infrastructure for the Node.js ecosystem, serving binaries, documentation, and release assets to millions of developers worldwide.

### 1.1 Purpose
- Provide structured response to security incidents
- Minimize impact on Node.js ecosystem
- Ensure transparent communication with the community
- Enable rapid recovery and service restoration
- Learn from incidents to improve security posture

### 1.2 Scope
This plan covers security incidents including but not limited to:
- Supply chain compromise (serving malicious binaries)
- Service availability attacks (DDoS, resource exhaustion)
- Data integrity incidents (file corruption, checksum mismatches)
- Information disclosure (configuration leaks, internal details)
- Unauthorized access or privilege escalation
- Cache poisoning or content manipulation

## 2. Incident Classification

### 2.1 Severity Levels

#### P0 - Critical (Response Time: < 15 minutes)
**Definition**: Incidents with immediate, severe impact on Node.js ecosystem
**Examples**:
- Malicious Node.js binaries being served to users
- Complete service outage affecting all dist.nodejs.org endpoints
- Active supply chain attack with confirmed malicious content
- Widespread compromise affecting multiple Node.js installations

**Response Team**: Full incident response team activated immediately
**Escalation**: Node.js TSC, Cloudflare support, public advisory preparation

#### P1 - High (Response Time: < 30 minutes)
**Definition**: Incidents with significant impact on service availability or security
**Examples**:
- Partial service degradation affecting significant user base (>25%)
- Cache poisoning incidents affecting specific content
- Detected unauthorized access attempts with evidence of impact
- Security configuration compromise without immediate exploitation

**Response Team**: Core incident response team
**Escalation**: @nodejs/web-infra team, relevant maintainers

#### P2 - Medium (Response Time: < 2 hours)
**Definition**: Localized security issues with limited impact
**Examples**:
- Individual file corruption or checksum mismatches
- Performance degradation without service availability impact
- Security configuration issues without evidence of exploitation
- Suspicious activity without confirmed impact

**Response Team**: Technical lead and security analyst
**Escalation**: Incident commander if escalation needed

#### P3 - Low (Response Time: < 24 hours)
**Definition**: Minor security concerns requiring attention but no immediate risk
**Examples**:
- Security hardening opportunities identified
- Non-critical monitoring alerts
- Documentation security issues
- Preventive security measures needed

**Response Team**: Assigned maintainer
**Escalation**: Standard issue tracking process
