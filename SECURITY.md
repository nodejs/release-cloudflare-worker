## Reporting a security bug in Node.js Release Cloudflare Worker

Report security bugs in the Node.js Release Cloudflare Worker via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/nodejs) or by contacting the [Node.js Security Working Group](mailto:security@nodejs.org).

Normally, your report will be acknowledged within 5 days, and you'll receive
a more detailed response to your report within 10 days indicating the
next steps in handling your submission. These timelines may extend when
our triage volunteers are away on holiday, particularly at the end of the
year.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep
you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance surrounding the reported
issue.

## Node.js bug bounty program

The Node.js project engages in an official bug bounty program for security
researchers and responsible public disclosures. The program is managed through
the HackerOne platform and covers this repository. See <https://hackerone.com/nodejs> for further details.

## Disclosure policy

This repository follows the Node.js security disclosure policy:

* The security report is received and is assigned a primary handler. This
  person will coordinate the fix and release process. The problem is validated
  and confirmed. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems. 
  Fixes are prepared for the affected worker deployment. These fixes are not 
  committed to the public repository but rather held locally pending the announcement.

* A suggested embargo date for this vulnerability is chosen and a CVE (Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEÂ®)) is requested for the vulnerability.

* On the embargo date, a copy of the announcement is sent to the Node.js
  security mailing list. The changes are pushed to the public repository and the
  worker is deployed with the security fix. Within 6 hours of the mailing list being
  notified, a copy of the advisory will be published on the Node.js blog.

* Typically, the embargo date will be set 72 hours from the time the CVE is
  issued. However, this may vary depending on the severity of the bug or
  difficulty in applying a fix.

## Code of Conduct and Vulnerability Reporting Guidelines

When reporting security vulnerabilities, reporters must adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Code of Conduct Compliance**: All security reports must comply with the
   [Node.js Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
   Reports that violate the code of conduct will not be considered and may result 
   in being banned from future participation.

2. **No Harmful Actions**: Security research and vulnerability reporting must not:
   * Cause damage to the dist.nodejs.org infrastructure or production environments.
   * Disrupt Node.js distribution services or affect end users.
   * Attempt to access or modify Node.js release binaries or distribution files.
   * Include actual exploits that could harm the Node.js ecosystem.
   * Involve social engineering or phishing attempts against maintainers.

3. **Responsible Testing**: When testing potential vulnerabilities:
   * Use controlled, isolated test environments when possible.
   * Do not test against the production dist.nodejs.org infrastructure without prior authorization.
   * Do not attempt to access internal Cloudflare Worker logs or configuration.
   * Immediately stop testing if unauthorized access is gained accidentally.

4. **Report Quality**
   * Provide clear, detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   * Include only the minimum proof of concept required to demonstrate the issue.
   * Remove any malicious payloads or components that could cause harm.

## The Node.js Release Worker Threat Model

The Node.js Release Cloudflare Worker serves all Node.js binaries, documentation, 
and release assets via https://dist.nodejs.org. This critical infrastructure component
is trusted by the entire Node.js ecosystem.

### In Scope

Vulnerabilities that could lead to:

* **Supply Chain Attacks**: Serving modified or malicious Node.js binaries or release assets
* **Data Integrity Issues**: Corruption or manipulation of served files
* **Service Availability**: Denial of service attacks against the distribution infrastructure
* **Information Disclosure**: Exposure of internal infrastructure details or sensitive configuration
* **Cache Poisoning**: Manipulation of cached responses to serve incorrect content
* **Path Traversal**: Unauthorized access to files outside intended directory structure

### Trusted Elements

The worker trusts:

* The underlying Cloudflare Workers platform and infrastructure
* The R2 bucket storage containing official Node.js releases
* The origin server (origin.nodejs.org) used as a fallback
* The CI/CD pipeline and deployment process
* Collaborators with appropriate repository access

### Examples of Vulnerabilities

#### Supply Chain Manipulation (Critical)
* Serving modified Node.js binaries through cache poisoning or path manipulation
* Bypassing integrity checks to serve unauthorized content

#### Service Disruption (High)
* Resource exhaustion attacks causing worker failures
* Cache manipulation leading to widespread service degradation

#### Information Disclosure (Medium-High)
* Exposure of internal worker configuration or error details
* Leaking information about infrastructure or storage backend

### Examples of Non-Vulnerabilities

#### Expected Behavior
* Serving publicly available Node.js releases and documentation
* Directory listings for public release directories
* Standard HTTP cache headers and responses

#### Out of Scope
* Issues requiring compromise of trusted infrastructure (Cloudflare, GitHub Actions)
* Vulnerabilities in Node.js itself (report to main Node.js repository)
* General availability issues not caused by security vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident, please refer to the 
[Node.js Security Incident Response Plan](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/main/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md).

For immediate security incidents affecting dist.nodejs.org availability or integrity,
also contact the [@nodejs/web-infra](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/web-infra) team.
